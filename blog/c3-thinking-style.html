      Today I'll be talking about a few different ideas about thinking and learning. You can learn more about the thinking styles as presented by Anthony Gregorc, <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>. The fixed and growth mindset ideas come from Carol Dweck, and you can find out more about them, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/"> here</a>. So, let's dive right in to my thoughts after three weeks in Dev Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes during Phase 0 I've felt like the instructions and resources provided don't quite lead you directly to the answers to a challenge. I feel like there can be a gap between the reference materials we go through to learn a subject, and the requested application of the new knowledge. I suppose this gap that I perceive is directly correlated to my thinking style: Concrete Sequential. Identifying with this thinking style means I like (among other things) to follow predictable directions in a logical sequence. Sometimes the whole point of a DBC challenge (it seems) is to take you out of this mindset and to make you think outside the box; to expand upon the baseline knowledge you've been given without specific directions on how to do this expansion. For me, I see that as a gap in predictable directions. This has probably been the biggest struggle for me throughout my first few weeks here.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, this translates into learning and doing as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>My preferred approach would be something like this:</h4>
        <blockquote>Learn: a + b = c</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Do: 3 + 4 = x, solve for x</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>DBC's approach is more like this:</h4>
        <blockquote>Learn: a + b = c</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Do: x - 4 = 3, solve for x</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      I absolutely understand why Dev Bootcamp takes this different approach, but that doesn't mean it makes it easy for me! The whole point of a boot camp is to give you a lot and expect a lot, and I appreciate that. I've exercised my mind more in the past 3 weeks than I have in the last 3 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step after discovering your thinking style is figuring out how to adjust when something isn't presented in the style you're inclined to. Part of this is moving from a Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset. Fixed means forget it; I am the way I am, and if I get it - cool. If not, well, that's life and I had better find something else to be good at. (Doesn't that just sound lame?) Growth on the other hand means well, I am the way I am, but if I don't get it - that's ok. I'll try again in another way after learning from my failure. (Sounds like successâ€¦ Yes?) So easy to talk about, but a whole other ballgame when you actually try and shift your thinking to a growth mindset. Speaking from personal experience, it's freaking hard to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most practical ways to get through learning in a style that I may not prefer is by working with others who excel in that particular style. I find that when I work with someone who just gets it, even in an abstract way, that I can oftentimes work backwards through the solution to the point where it clicks for me. (Thank goodness for pairing sessions.) This also means that I need to just reach out more... Which, I unfortunately have a very hard time with. I think that if we weren't expected to do pairing sessions each week I may not do them at all - which would make this experience pretty dreadful. Not gonna lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, can your thinking and learning methods change? Absolutely. Is it going to be easy? Probably not. Does that mean just stay the way you are? Not possible if you're in DBC. :)
