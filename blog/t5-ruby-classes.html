  <h1>Such a Classy House, Ruby</h1>
  <h2>A bit of an intro to classes in Ruby</h2>

      I've often heard referenced that creating a class in ruby is like creating a blueprint for an object. So, because a blueprint makes me think of a house, I'm going to create a simple class called <code>House</code> today that's going to help us provide home listings by number of bedrooms and bathrooms (because, really, aren't those the very first things that we consider when looking for a new place to live?).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, first we'll want to set up the basic structure for our <code>House</code> class:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="..\images\basic-house-class.png" alt="basic-house-class.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now that we've got that down, we'll want to make sure that we include the number of bedrooms and bathrooms each time we add a new house using this class. That way we can display those values when talking about new house size later. To do this, we'll want to create an <code>initialize</code> method that includes what're called instance variables. This makes it possible for us to use the bedroom and bathroom numbers (variables) later on in the <code>House</code> class we've created.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="..\images\initialize-house-class.png" alt="initialize-house-class.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      In order to use those instance variables we created above, let's create an instance method called <code>greet</code> that we'll use to display the bedroom and bathroom count in a string when we call on it. Instance method just means that this method can be called on new instances of the <code>House</code> class (or, rather, each time we add a new house using the <code>House</code> class).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="..\images\method-house-class.png" alt="method-house-class.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Ok great, we've got our <code>House</code> class all set up, let's see what we can do with it:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="..\images\call-listings-house-class.png" alt="call-listings-house-class.png">
      <img src="..\images\listings-house-class.png" alt="listings-house-class.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Fantastic! We added two houses to our list, and now we can tell potential renters or buyers how many bedrooms and bathrooms each one has with a simple call of the instance method greet. This is a pretty simple example of how classes work in Ruby, but hopefully it's provided a bit of classy insight. ah-wink.
