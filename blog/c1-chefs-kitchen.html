      Coming into Dev Bootcamp I had so many different emotions, anxieties, expectations, fears, perceptions, notions, ideas, worries, motivations... The list could go on and on. Now that I'm just about finished with my first week of Dev Bootcamp, I have to say that I still have a lot of those feelings! Dev Bootcamp is a learning experience like I've never seen before.

        For starters, if you don't have initiative to learn new things, I'm pretty sure Dev Bootcamp won't be for you. It's shocking and at the same time empowering how much you'll need to be comfortable with searching for information and finding answers on your own. This doesn't mean that you're all on your own, but it does mean that you have to be comfortable with searching for information, and potentially reaching out to your cohort or dbc staff/alums when you just can't figure something out. This can be a hard thing to do, but once you get your feet wet and reach out to your cohort, you'll see that the responses are so so quick, friendly, and always helpful. Don't forget that you're not alone! You just have to reach out and ask.

        It's been a while since I've been in a formal learning environment, so it's definitely going to take a bit of getting used to being a student again. Luckily, Dev Bootcamp's curriculum is centered on all the things that made me want to join Dev Bootcamp in the first place! I find it very refreshing to get straight into the meat of the program, instead of taking hours of pre-requisite courses before getting there.

		Although I think Dev Bootcamp is going to be one of the biggest challenges I'll have ever taken on, I'm convinced I'll be a better person for it. I've been working in Administrative and Operations type positions for about nine years now, and it's been about that long since I've really felt challenged or challenged myself. I've become complacent in the daily grind, and status quo of living. Well, I can't take it anymore! There has to be something better for me out there. If I've got to work for a living, then there has to be a way to release my passion for puzzles, problem-solving, and details, and use them in my career. If completing Dev Bootcamp doesn't get me all the way there, I believe it's at least the first step to finding the career that works for me.
