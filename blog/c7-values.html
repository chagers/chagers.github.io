  <h1>Making Positivity Happen</h1>
  <h2>Or in Ella Fitzgerald's words: Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive</h2>

    <p>
      Today I'll be continuing the conversation a bit on stereotype threat (see last week's post), and talking about how values we hold may influence the possibility of this threat in some way. First, let's talk about values.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I've been most proud, happy, satisfied, etc., I've found some of the following values come to mind:
    </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Accomplishment  
              </li>
              <li>
                Achievement
              </li>
              <li>
                Close relationships
              </li>
              <li>
                Compassion
              </li>
              <li>
                Confidence
              </li>
              <li>
                Creativity
              </li>
              <li>
                Efficiency
              </li>
            </ul>          
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Excitement
              </li>
              <li>
                Friendships
              </li>
              <li>
                Inspiration
              </li>
              <li>
                Music
              </li>
              <li>
                Nature
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal development
              </li>
              <li>
                Self-reliance
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p>
      These are just a few examples of the variety of values and emotions that I can feel when happiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a scale of 1 through 5, 1 being Disagree and 5 being Agree, I would say that absolutely 5 out of 5 I try and live up to these values. It may get hard when the going gets tough, but when that happens I find it helpful to take myself out of the moment and look at my life as if from a third person perspective. It helps to take a look at everything as a whole when so often it's easy to get caught up in the minutiae of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these values that takes on a bigger role in my life would be personal development. While this value isn't necessarily the most important value, I feel it holds all other values within it. Part of personal development is taking and learning from those other values and adding it to the self as a whole, increasing satisfaction in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've got a friend who seems to find the negative in just about anything and it's been a real challenge trying to reiterate to them that their life is actually amazing and they just need to remember the good stuff! Part of personal development is taking the values you hold dear and remembering that you actually do hold them dear. Remember what makes you happy and focus on that every now and again. I promise it will do wonders! Yes, I know it can be easier said than done sometimes, but that's why you just have to at least try to think positive. Even if for only 5 minutes a day - it'll at least start you down the path of positivity and personal development in the direction you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about the values that you hold dearest will absolutely help with combating stereotype threat. Instead of focusing on the perceived threat, just focus on the self and what gets you through the day and happy. Sometimes it can be hard not to think about the perception others may have of you when you're in a stressful situation, but maybe if you just take a minute, close your eyes, and think about what you're doing, why you're in the situation, and looking at it as if from a third person perspective, you may be able to refocus your mind and complete the task at hand more successfully than you thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's all about perspective, and sometimes it's very easy to lose that. Especially when you're putting yourself out there and learning an entirely new subject - like right now for me at Dev Bootcamp. I've had days where I completely lose perspective of why I'm here because I'm so caught up in frustration with a particular concept or challenge. Taking a step back and reflecting on how far I've come, and remembering why I'm here has helped immensely. Yeah, it may be hard to step back at times, but when I do I feel all the better for it. Staying positive can be so hard sometimes, but even if you take a few minutes out of your day to sit back and remember the positive things in your life you'll feel better and perform better because of it. I'm sure of it!

      If you're having trouble accentuating the positive, take a queue from Ella Fitzgerald's song!
