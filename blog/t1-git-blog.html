  <h1>Keeping Track of Changes in Git</h1>
  <h2>My first technical blog post</h2>

    Today I'll be writing my first technical blog post... So bear with me! I'm going to give a brief description of Git's use of version control, as well as why GitHub is a good place to store code.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help keep track of changes over time, Git uses version control. Version control is a system of recording all revisions you may make to a project over time. With all revisions being recorded in history, this means that you may revert any files or documents within a project back to a previous state in time. So, no matter what you're doing, or how complex an update you're making, if things end up going whacky at some point, then no worries! You can just go back to the version where everything was still working smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way Git keeps track of all these changes is by cloning the repository your project is on to your computer, and the computers of whoever else is working on that project with you. This means that not only is Git keeping track of your individual updates, but keeping track of them within the repository as a whole. Especially handy if someone's system goes down - someone else will have a copy of the entire repository, not just their individual changes. 
    </p>

        In addition to having Git keeping versions under control, there is GitHub to serve as a host to your repositories. Why GitHub? GitHub is currently the largest host for Git repositories - so you know it's tried and tested. GitHub provides a venue for you to review code, track issues, and receive feedback on all your hosted repositories. It's a great place for developers to collaborate on work, and to gather feedback on open-source projects.
