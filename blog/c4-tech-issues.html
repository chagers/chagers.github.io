  <h1>Diversity in the Tech Industry</h1>
  <h2>Let's "git" interested earlier</h2>

    <p>
      Since Google released its <a href: "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">diversity in their workforce numbers last year</a>, diversity in the tech industry overall has become a subject that more and more people are becoming aware of. It's pretty staggering how homogenous the tech industry is - with the majority of employees being white and male. The problem, however, may not be completely at the time of hire, but instead much much earlier - at the time when kids become interested in technology - in our elementary through high school years.

      In the Mother Jones piece <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">"We Can Code It!"</a> Tasneem Raja points out that:
    </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
          In fact, even as the Department of Labor <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_102.htm">predicts</a> the nation will add 1.2 million new computer-science-related jobs by 2022, we're graduating proportionately <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_322.10.asp">fewer</a> computer science majors than we did in the 1980s, and the number of students signing up for Advanced Placement computer science has <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/2013/2013-Exam-Volume-Change.pdf">flatlined</a>.
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      At this time it looks like our schools just aren't creating the pipeline that the tech industry needs to help increase diversity in the workplace. Kids need to become excited about and learn to code at younger ages when we were all more excited about learning in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raja also notes that <a class="midquote" href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">"To produce tech-savvy citizens "at scale," to borrow an industry term, the heavy lifting will happen in public school classrooms."</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means our public schools need to go through a revamp of the curriculum that is offered to our little ones. Get them excited to learn code while they're excited to learn about, well, just about everything they come across. We need to go beyond just using technology to understanding how that technology works. This also means getting both boys and girls excited about technology and computing. The Association for Computing conducted a <a href:"http://www.acm.org/membership/NIC.pdf">survey</a> in 2008 among high school students that found the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most college-bound males have a positive opinion of computing and computer science as a possible college major or career.
        </li>
        <li>
          College-bound African American and Hispanic teens are more likely than their white peers to be interested in computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          College-bound females, regardless of race and ethnicity, are significantly less interested than boys are in computing. More <span>girls</span> tend to associate computing with “typing,” “math,” and “boredom,” while <span>boys</span> are more likely to associate computing with “video games,” “design,” “electronics,” “solving problems,” and “interesting.”
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="closing">
      Clearly, our schools have got a lot of work to do in getting youngsters more interested in tech, especially among the non-white male cohorts! Let's get those interest levels up America - let's "git" our kids excited about tech early.
