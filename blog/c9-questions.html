      We've all had questions at some point or another. Why is the sky blue? Do all dogs go to heaven? Are we there yet? Assumedly, our repertoire of questions has gotten a bit more specific over the years than those examplesâ€¦ Am I right? If so, then we've all come across situations where we've had to ask our questions in a very specific way in order to get the specific answer we're looking for. This can be a bit of a challenge - I mean, you don't know what the answer you're looking for is, so how do you know how to ask it! Well, there are a few tips and tricks to ensuring we're getting the best help we can when answering questions. In this particular post I'll talk about asking questions on an on-line forum, but the info should be applicable to all sorts of situations in which we need to ask questions. So, let's get started!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure you've done <b>research</b> on your own before asking a question. No one likes to help lazy people find answers, so make sure you've done your bit first! We've all seen how quickly someone will tell the asker that their question has already been answered on Stack Overflow.. So don't be that person!
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Give your question a meaningful <b>title</b>. As exemplified in this post's title, "Method: Question?!" may make perfect sense at the moment the question comes up. But take a moment, a step back, and read the title again. What's the question? Method of what? Method in a language? Method of how to butter toast? Clearly, this title creates more questions than is necessary or even interesting to read more about. Give your question a fighting chance by giving it a good title:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Think about the title as a header to an article. A little tidbit of information about what's to come.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try and phrase the title of the question as a question in and of itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write in full sentences - don't let the reader get caught up on your bad grammar! They'll be more than likely to just move on to the next question on the list.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Set up</b> the problem you're having at a high level before getting into any details. Give the reader a chance to understand what they're getting into before diving any further.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure to talk about the languages, or API you're specifically using to solve the problem with. This will ensure that the reader understands how to give you a productive answer in the same language you're asking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember to keep this informative but brief. You don't want to bore your reader already!
          </li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, you'll want to give the <b>details</b> of your problem.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Give some more background of where your problem came from. A reader may be able to find a better way to solve your problem if they've got a bit of context as far as the end goal of your problem - instead of just a snippet in time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think about what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mention any other research you've done and why it didn't give you the answer you're looking for, or why it didn't make sense in your situation.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide working <b>examples</b> of your problem.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you can't provide exact code, make sure you modify in a way that still mirrors the exact problem. Otherwise, there's no chance you'll get what you were looking for!
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide just enough to display your problem, but not so much that the reader has to scan through lines and lines to find where the problem lies.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, you'll want to make sure you <b>proofread</b> your question before sending it off into the world!
        <ul>
          <li>
            Like with your title, make sure your reader isn't going to get hung up by bad grammar or multiple spelling mistakes instead of getting to the meat of the question and helping you find an answer!
          </li>
        </ul><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are just a few tips and tricks to helping ask good questions in order to get good answers. Try searching around online for more examples of good and bad questions. Try reading your online forum's rules for posting - these usually give examples of how to post effective questions. Remember to follow the rules of how to post on your online forum. We've all seen how riled up readers/answerers can get when posts don't meet the minimum criteria...

      Good luck out there, and don't ever stop asking questions!
