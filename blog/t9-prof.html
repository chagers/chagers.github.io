  <h1>Timeboxing That Website</h1>
  <h2>And other lessons learned while designing my first site</h2>

      Websites were made to be updated - indeed they were. However, the time it takes to update a website (especially your personal website) can get pretty out of hand unless you have the good sense to keep yourself in check during the updates.
    </p>
    <p>
    	I'm my own worst critic. There have been so many times I sit and torture myself over the smallest of details when working on my own project - often it seems - completely unaware of what I'd actually like the end state to be! No matter how much wire-framing, or review of the intent and purpose of my site, it seems I'll just want to recreate my vision right in the middle of my process. Takes a lot of reigning in to go back to my original vision and intent, and just stick to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In that sense, it's been great practice on understanding the importance of wireframes and sticking to the original picture. Get something done - then move towards improvements. If I've taken the time in the beginning to really understand what is needed from a website, and consider how the aesthetic can enhance this need, then the original idea should be a solid place to get started. A total re-haul of the site shouldn't be in the future if a good base has been created.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The part where this gets especially difficult, though, is when designing websites is a brand new and blossoming skill! Of course I'll learn more interesting ways to build sites, and different display tricks, and different framing sites to try out. But, the important thing to remember is my original intent and need for the website hasn't changed. Just the fun stuff I get to add to it and change about it.
    </p>
    <p>
    	I took a stab at using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework for refurbishing my personal website. It's been a pretty big learning curve to try and figure out exactly what I can do with this framework, and how it can make my updates easier in the future, but it's definitely been fun trying new things. I think my site is a bit cleaner and more streamlined, but it still is pretty simplistic at this point. This is where timeboxing came to be especially important for this update. Lots of rabbit holes to go down when learning a new sort of language!
    </p>
    <p>
    	So, overall I'd say there are a few things I'd recommend keeping in mind when creating websites:
    	<ol>
    		<li>Time box! Think about how much time you think is reasonable for each of the design steps in creating a website and really try and stick to it. Future self will be grateful!</li><br>
    		<li>Set up a plan for your site (outside of the computer) and think about everything you could possibly want out of the site (you'll most likely tone this list down, but have some fun with it at this point!).</li><br>
    		<li>Sketch out your idea on paper. These sketches can be quick and dirty, but take the time to just draw out a few ideas of how you want your site to look and function. This helps me wireframe more efficiently. For me, it's much easier to draw ten pencil sketches in a book than it is to throw together ten wireframes before settling on the final one.</li><br>
    		<li>Spend your time wireframing your sketches. This is going to be the template you go back to time and again when it comes to designing your website, so make sure you detail it enough to be helpful to your future self.</li><br>
    		<li>When it comes time to create your site, envision an end point. Try and stick to that! Even if it's just the endpoint for a minimum viable product. Once I've finished something to the point where it functions, it's much easier and less overwhelming to go back and update small things a bit at a time.</li><br>
    		<li>Revisit the website and update as needed. Don't let the site grow cold and static after working so hard on getting it set up!</li><br>
    	</ol>
