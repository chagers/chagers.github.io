  <h1>JavaScript, Ruby, and Documentation</h1>
  <h2>Oh the differences you can find.</h2>

      This week at Dev Bootcamp we've been learning JavaScript. After living and learning in the Ruby world for the past few weeks it's been a real change of gears diving into another language. Some of the differences are slight, while others are pretty glaring. Today I'll be talking about the differences in the built-in methods that each language comes with, as well as how you can find those built-in methods. It's been a challenge (albeit, fun challenge!) to have to get creative in JavaScript when you come across an instance where you'd like to use a built-in method that Ruby has but doesn't exist in JavaScript!
    </p>
    <p>
      The differences also stem from the difference in documentation of the two languages online. For example, you can go to Ruby-Docs.org, search for the Class <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Array.html">Array</a>, and bam - you've got a nice list on the left-hand side of about 95 different methods that are built into this class and that you can use to manipulate and work with the data in an Array.

      JavaScript - well, not as exhaustive a list. On the W3Schools site there are about 17 methods listed when you search for <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp">JavaScript Array Reference</a>.

    </p>
      Here's the kicker though - this is not an exhaustive list! For example, if you wanted to add all the numbers together in an array and return the total, you'd want to use the reduce method. However, I've been unable to find this on the W3Schools site. So, I had to complete another search and find it on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">Mozilla Developer Network</a> site.

      This is a big difference between the two languages: documentation. With Ruby,  the go-to site for research on all things Ruby is Ruby-Docs. While the examples that are listed with each method on the Ruby-Docs site may not be the best around, at least you know where to go to find all available methods before you decide whether or not you need to research further. With JavaScript, I'm still searching at least a couple sites before being satisfied that I've found the right method (or lack thereof!) to use and/or research further!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this may just be because I've only spent a week with JavaScript and I just haven't found the most efficient research tools yet, but within a week of learning Ruby I already knew that Ruby-Docs was going to be my new best friend. Overall, the sites above are just a few examples of the endless resources that you can find online - so go out and find your own best research friends, and have fun coding!
