  <h1>Arrays &amp; Hashes</h1>

     When trying to decide whether to use an array or a hash, it's probably best to start off with a definition of each:
    </p>
    <definition id="array_def">
      An array is a list of things (numbers, words, characters, etc.) that can be referred to by using their index number. The index number is just the number that correlates to the spot where the thing lies in the array (list). For example:
    </definition>
    <figure id="array_pic">
      <img src="..\images\array.png" alt="array example" title="array">
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this example we're referring to our array as "array" (clever, right?). The things in our list are "a, b, c, d". The thing in the first spot in our list is index number 0, the thing in the second spot in our list is index number 1, etc. Be sure to note that in arrays, the index always starts with 0, not 1.
    </p>
    <definition id="hash_def">
      Meanwhile, a hash is also a list of things, but those things are referred to by what's called a key. A key, as opposed to an index, can be anything you assign it to be. For example:
    </definition>
    <figure id="hash_pic">
      <img src="..\images\hash.png" alt="hash example" title="hash">
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this example we're referring to our hash as "hash" (yeah, I know). The things in our list are "bread", "spoon", and "plate". The thing "bread" in our list has the key of "food", the thing "plate" in our list has the key of "dish", and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main difference between an array and a hash is how each thing in them is referred to. The things, or elements, in an array are referred to by their index numbers, and index numbers are always assigned in the order of the list as written. Alternately, because you assign the keys to each element in a hash, there doesn't need to be any order to how the items are listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That brings us to the basic reason why you'd use a hash instead of an array: If you don't have a particular order to the items in your list, but you still want to have a list and keep track of the elements in that list - use a hash. If order makes sense in your list - use an array.
