  <h1>Computer Memory Basics</h1>

      This week we'll be talking a bit about computer memory. What is it? Why do our computers need it? Why is it important to computer programmers?
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, the basics.. When we talk about memory, much like in regards to human memory, we're referring to the device(s) that store information for a computer. For us, that would be equivalent to our brain. For computers, memory can take a few different forms and types. One type is referred to as primary memory, which functions at high speeds. This would be the most common way to think of memory when we hear it talked about when buying a new computer. Another type is referred to as secondary memory, and comes in the form of program and data storage, which functions at lower speeds but with higher memory capacity. This would be what's referred to as the hard drive. Takes a bit longer to access, but holds just about every important element to our computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for having primary and secondary levels of memory is so our computers can function quickly. If our computer had to access its hard drive for every function we asked it to do, it would take quite a long time to get anything done! So, that's why the first line of memory when we ask our computers to complete tasks is the primary memory. An important thing to remember about primary memory is that it's meant to store things temporarily - that's why it's fast. It remembers what it needs to for the task at hand, but can clear that memory to make way for a new task at a moment's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the world of computer programming, we'll often hear of code being 'expensive' or 'cheap'. This was pretty strange for me to hear at first until I understood that it refers to how much memory code needs to run. So, the more memory code uses, the more 'expensive' that code is - the less memory it uses, the cheaper it is. At this point in my programming career my programs are fairly small, but not necessarily cheap! The whole point of learning how to code efficiently, and understanding the best way to get the task at hand done quickly and simply is so that your programming can be cheap! Sounds strange, I know, but cheap in this regard actually is a good thing.

      So, in review:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Memory: the ways in which our computers store information to operate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our computers need memory in order to operate quickly and efficiently for our ever increasing needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computer programmers need to take memory into account when writing programs so they can write the cheapest and most efficient programs and processes as possible!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      And in closingâ€¦ When talking about computer memory, do some research and don't be this guy:
