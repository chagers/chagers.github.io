  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

      Today I will be talking about the idea of stereotype threat; What is it? Can we do anything about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      In its most basic form I think stereotype threat can be considered an example of the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy. If I'm worried about how I will do on a test, then most likely I will do worse than if I'm just taking the test 'for fun'. This is exemplified with the quizzes that DBC just instituted at the end of each week in Phase 0. In the first few weeks, the quizzes gave back a taker's score in the form of a percentage. Because of this, many of the test-takers became completely distracted by what they hoped their scores would be at the end of the test. Because they were worried about how they would be 'scored' at the end of the test, they most likely ended up underperforming. I know this was true for me. I was so concerned at how I would be graded, that I over-thought the questions, and made some silly mistakes. These silly mistakes resulted in a low percentage of correct answers, even though I knew and understood the material that the quiz was covering, and quickly understood what my mistakes were when analyzing the results.

      The additional factor that stereotype threat adds to the self-fulfilling prophecy idea is that it creates a fear that one is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">"at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group."</a> So, if a woman is taking a computer science test, the idea that she's going to confirm the stereotype that women don't excel at computer science may affect her overall score on that test. She may be so preoccupied with the idea of proving this stereotype correct that she ends up distracted and underperforms.

      I had never thought about the idea of stereotype threat before. It creates this idea that perhaps when taking these quizzes I was holding onto this stereotype threat. It's interesting to consider whether my test results were actually a product of stereotype threat, or just plain test-taking in general, though. Did I make silly mistakes because of this stereotype threat, or did I make silly mistakes just because taking tests make me nervous?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think one way to attempt to overcome this idea is to remember the idea that test-taking, or rather performance monitoring in general, is a very nerve-wracking thing. For everyone. If possible, don't think about the test in front of you as a greater representative whole of your place in society. That's just way too much pressure! Take it down to the basics. This test is covering the concepts that I've been studying. Simple. To the point. No greater meaning, no comparison to everyone else taking the test.

      This idea is exemplified in this interesting tidbit from the <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">Diversity Inc. article</a> on the topic:
      <blockquote>
        In one study, he [Dr. Claude Steele] asked two groups of black and white college students to take a 30-minute test made up of questions from the verbal section of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)â€¦ When one group was told the test would measure their intellectual ability, black students underperformed dramatically. But when another group was told the test could not measure intellectual ability, blacks and whites performed at virtually the same level.
      </blockquote>

      Very interesting results. This idea of confirming for yourself what the test is all about and not worrying about what it means for anyone else but yourself and your knowledge seems to be a good step in trying to combat stereotype threat. I think it's also a good step for any test taker, in any societal group as well.
    </p>

      Performing to your best ability can be hard for everyone. Especially for those groups that aren't "supposed" to perform well at certain tasks. But maybe just try and remember the basic reasons for your performance? That may be the key to bringing back perspective to the self.

      Now the hard part - taking my own advice!
