  <h1>Who's the Driver?</h1>
  <h2>Some thoughts on pairing and feedback at Dev Bootcamp</h2>

      Today I'll be talking a little bit about what it's like to code in pairs and get feedback on those pairing sessions during Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pairing to figure out challenges and write code is basically working with another person on a project, but with more structure. During a DBC pairing session, one person serves as the navigator, and one as the driver. In my mind, they really mean the same thing except for the driver is the designated code-writer, and the navigator is the code/instructions-reader and potential quick researcher. In seamless pairing sessions, the driver and navigator naturally guide each other through the process of solving a challenge. Each party gives equal input to the solution, it just so happens that only one of them is actually writing out the code.

      Luckily, I've had some pairing sessions that have gone just like that, but there's always the off-sessions where it doesn't quite work as seamlessly...

      The hard part is trying to get on the same page at the start of the session. It's hard to remember that you really need to stop and talk about what each role means to each person before getting started. I've had some sessions where the definitions are pretty different from mine. Sometimes the driver proceeds as if they are literally driving the entire session - reading instructions, thinking of code to write, writing code, and the navigator is just there to help when the driver needs. Sometimes the driver expects the navigator to literally spell out everything they need to code. Sometimes the driver expects to not have to think about how to write the code, but instead have the navigator think out loud. I really could go on and on because, as you can see, there are countless ways for these two roles to be interpreted.

      The most revealing time when this distinction hasn't been made in a pairing session is when feedback on the session is given. At DBC each time you pair you also give feedback on that pairing session. Luckily, there are some good guidelines for giving feedback, and written in a handy acronym: ASK (Actionable, Specific, and Kind). It allows for some very productive feedback. In a nutshell, it means to write feedback that's kind-hearted, with specific examples noted from the session, and suggestions that the reader could actually use and act upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's really helped reading the reviews on how people thought coding sessions went with me, and given me some confidence that I'm doing this whole pairing thing right. The most interesting part about how DBC manages all the feedback is that they have each person rate other feedback that's been given (all anonymously). This gives some really interesting feedback on the feedback you've written (so meta!). I've received a few reviews on my feedback that were not really as I expected. There have been reviews I've given that I thought were very strong in certain areas of the ASK, but were not rated as such. The meta feedback really makes you consider what you're writing after each pairing session, and to write clearly and meaningfully.
    </p>

      Pairing and feedback go hand-in-hand at Dev Bootcamp, and you'll see a lot of both! If you're interested in joining, come prepared to read some honest thoughts on your performance, and also give some honest feedback on your cohort's performance. In the end, it's how we all become better coworkers in this coding community.
