  <h1>Conflict Can Help</h1>
  <h2>Take a closer look at what's really going on</h2>

      This week Dev Bootcamp asked us to talk about a conflict that we've had in our past. What was it, why'd you have it, what'd you do about it, etc. Right away I thought of a conflict I had with an old coworker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was working as a dispatcher in a field that was entirely new to me. I was trying to learn all the necessary info to be good at my job, but hey - I was new!  I was trying my very best. Well, my best wasn't good enough for my coworker Tom, and he definitely let me know it. Every time I talked to Tom about a job I needed to send him on or tried to ask a question it was one short, curt, and rude exchange after another. I knew that because I was a newbie that I'd have to just put in my time with the guys that had been there for years because, well, that's just the pecking order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, after about two months of this same rudeness from Tom I just couldn't take it anymore. This was not a work environment I wanted to be in! So, after many venting sessions with friends and family about how Tom was the problem, I tried a new approach. Maybe the problem wasn't really my abilities as a dispatcher. Maybe I was learning the trade, but Tom just wasn't seeing it, or wasn't wanting to see it. Or, maybe, it really was me and I just wasn't getting it! So, I decided I'd try and flip the script on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to my boss and asked her if I could go on a ride-along with Tom to learn more about the field and how he does his job. My boss agreed to the ride-along and, fortunately, Tom agreed to it as well. Later that week we went out on the job for a whole day together, and… well… the results? Amazing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just the act of me initiating that ride-along completely changed Tom's attitude towards me. He no longer answered my questions rudely or curtly, and actually tried to help explain things to me and help me learn. While we were driving between jobs that day, I was able to chat with Tom a bit more freely than in we usually would, and found out that he's gone through so many dispatchers over the years that just didn't care about the work or learning the trade, so he figured what's the point?!
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say the working situation for Tom and I got much better after that, and he was my go-to guy for any questions, and even just to chat about work. Seems like it was the same for him with me (well maybe not the questions part!), and for the rest of my time at that job we had a great working relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      That situation taught me so much about really trying to figure out what the actual problem is in a conflict, and always remembering that there is another perspective than your own to consider. If I were to change anything about that conflict situation, it would be to ask for that ride-along sooner than I did!
